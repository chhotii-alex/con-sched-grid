Note: Time for audience participation is reserved for the end of our panel's high speed review."," Randee Dawn (m), Marianna Martin PhD, Timothy J Tero, Ari Donnelly, Gordon Linzner"
3,Sun,4:00 PM,1hr 15min,Otis,Media,Panel,Welcome,Star Wars: Episode 2020: The Fandom Gabfest,"Last month, The Rise of Skywalker hit screens, and with it the Star Wars sequel trilogy came to a close. That won't be the last we interact with this world, however; the tepid audience response for Solo may have encouraged Disney to dial back on the ""new film every year"" pace, but there's still plenty of lightsabers in our future, with new trilogies from both Rian Johnson and from David Benihoff & D.B. Weiss on the horizon. We'll reflect on the state of Star Wars and discuss what's next!"," Mink Rose, Jennifer Pelland, Dan Toland (m), Kevin Cafferty, Monica Castillo"
4,Sat,4:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 2,Media,Panel,Welcome,"Marvel Cinematic Universe, 2019 Edition","While we could spend an entire panel talking about Avengers: Endgame and the culmination of an eleven-year, 22 film epic storytelling event, 2019 had Captain Marvel and Spider-Man: Far From Home hit theaters as well. Further, with the Disney/Fox merger, Dark Phoenix retroactively became Kevin Feige's problem. With a slew of forthcoming announcements at this year's SDCC panel, come talk with us about the shakeups to the Marvel Universe and where things will go from here!"," Marianna Martin PhD, Timothy Luz, Troy Minkowsky, Morgan Crooks (m), Sara Codair"
5,Sat,2:30 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 2,Media,Panel,Welcome,Box Office Bombs That Are Better Than You Think,"Every year there's a film that comes out and tanks something awful. Sometimes, however, that's not because they were terrible; perhaps the studio overspent, or promotion was lacking, or the stars failed to align, and a worthy(-ish) film just didn't work. Perhaps you thought Hugo was gorgeous, or John Carter was fun, or you're the one who'll defend Speed Racer to anyone who'll listen. What movies do you feel deserve a better reputation, despite their not having been financially successful?"," Deirdre Crimmins, Gabriel Valdez, Griffin Ess , Sonya Taaffe (m), Ari Donnelly"
7,Sun,10:00 AM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Media,Panel,Welcome,2019: The Year in Horror,"2019 had something for every horror film aficionado. Brightburn gave us the darker side of superheroes. Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark aimed its scares squarely at younger audiences. Blumhouse Pictures continued its run of offerings like Ma and Happy Death Day 2U. Big releases (It: Chapter Two, Us, Midsommar), reboots of old favorites (Child's Play, Pet Sematary) and comedies (The Dead Don't Die, Zombieland: Double Tap) filled out the roster. We'll run down the best of what we saw this year!"," Deirdre Crimmins, Timothy Luz, Megan Kearns, Corinne Luz (m), Troy Minkowsky"
8,Fri,5:30 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Media,Panel,PG,Introduction to Anime,"Streaming services make anime easier to access than ever before, but the sheer number of options can be daunting for a new viewer or returning fan. Our panelists help guide you to your new favorite series based on what you've watched before (whether it was Sailor Moon in the 1990s or Pokemon yesterday) or based on non-anime genres you enjoy (what could you watch if you like Star Wars or Stranger Things?) What resources are out there that might guide you to other shows once you leave Arisia?"," Richard Ralston (m), Reuben Baron, Julia Pugliese, Paul Geromini, Joseph Andelman"
10,Sat,10:00 AM,1hr 15min,Faneuil,Media,Panel,Welcome,Guillermo del Toro: The Night Eternal,"For thirty-five years, Guillermo del Toro has brought his uniquely dark and beautiful vision to the screens. From his early Spanish-language fantasies (Cronos, The Devil's Backbone, Pan's Labyrinth) to big-budget Hollywood blockbusters (Blade II, Hellboy, Pacific Rim), to his Oscar-winning The Shape of Water, he has proven equally at home helming all manner of stories. We'll look at the remarkable career of this visionary filmmaker."," Deirdre Crimmins, Gabriel Valdez, Reuben Baron, Liz Salazar, Monica Castillo"
11,Sat,10:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 4,Media,Panel,Welcome,Rocky Horror: A Wild and Untamed Thing at 45,"In 1975, this adaptation of Richard O'Brien's cult stage sensation fared poorly with audiences. But within a year, The Rocky Horror Picture Show became a midnight favorite as a new crowd discovered it, and with it a community that accepted and upraised them. More of an event than a movie, we'll look back on our own experiences with a film that launched careers, celebrated cheesy B-movies, and had us milling around Church Street in Harvard Square every weekend."," Max Impakt / Ask Kaylee Frye, Susan Weiner, Dan ""Grim"" Marsh (m), Sam Schreiber, Kristina Carroll"
13,Mon,10:00 AM,1hr 15min,Faneuil,Media,Panel,Welcome,Pixar: 25 Years (and Beyond!),"After producing a handful of shorts, Pixar made its mark with the theatrical release of Toy Story, a feature-length triumph of what was then the relatively new field of computer animation. 25 years and 21 films later, we'll gather to discuss the remarkable body of work that's defined animated storytelling for a generation."," Christopher K. Davis, Rachel Kenley, Andy Hicks, Heather Urbanski (m), Arthur Chu"
14,Fri,10:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Media,Panel,Welcome,Freaks and Geeks Can Buy Its Own Beer Now,"21 years ago, Paul Feig's Freaks and Geeks presented the most realistic, least glamorized view of high school seen in popular entertainment. Following two groups of outcasts, one troubled and rebellious, the other socially awkward, it famously set a standard of high quality, it launched the careers of many young actors, including Seth Rogen, James Franco, Linda Cardellini, Jason Segel, Martin Starr, and more. Come look back on the tragically short run and long-lasting legacy of Freaks and Geeks."," Kevin Cafferty, Kevin Eldridge (m), Wendee Abramo, Dr. Jim Prego"
15,Sun,8:30 AM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Media,Panel,Welcome,1999: The Year Nobody Left The Theater,"1999 was another one of those years where it seemed like there was a new genre film in the cinemas every week: The Matrix, The Iron Giant, Being John Malkovich, The Sixth Sense, The Mummy, Toy Story 2, South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut, plus that one with the midichlorians in it. How many did you see before the Y2K bug destroyed modern civilization?"," Andy Hicks, Randee Dawn, Nomi S. Burstein (m), Troy Minkowsky, Arthur Chu, Monica Castillo"
16,Sun,5:30 PM,1hr 15min,Otis,Media,Panel,Welcome,The Nice and Accurate Ineffability of Good Omens,"The long-awaited adaptation of Neil Gaiman's and Terry Pratchett's 1990 apocalyptic novel Good Omens came to Amazon Prime last summer. In six episodes, we met an enormous cast, saw the world on the brink of destruction, and also there was a dog, but it was the rich portrayal of the millennia-spanning relationship between angel Aziraphale and demon Crowley that truly connected with many. Come discuss what you felt about the miniseries and how well it lived up to the material."," A.J. Odasso (m), Julia Gilstein, Karen S., Gabriel Valdez, Lee C. Hillman (Gwendolyn Grace)"
18,Mon,2:30 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 2,Media,Panel,Welcome,Arisia Casting Call: The Fantastic Four,"At SDCC 2019, it was announced that, after the merger of Fox and Disney, the Fantastic Four would be coming to the MCU. Kevin Feige has a lot on his plate, however, so as a favor, we're going to decide, in 75 minutes, who should be cast as Mr. Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, the Thing, and Marvel's uber-bad guy Doctor Doom. You're welcome, Disney!"," Pablo Vazquez, Corinne Luz, Michael A. Burstein (m), Daniel Neff"
19,Sat,8:30 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 4,Media,Panel,Welcome,The Orville: Its Continuing Mission,"Many wrote off The Orville as ""Family Guy in Space"". We soon saw that Seth MacFarlane's SF outing was actually a surprisingly straight-faced love letter to the space operas of his youth, especially Star Trek: The Next Generation. In between the antics, The Orville has tackled such weighty topics as racism, gender identity, and religious fanaticism. Our panel will go over the ways the Orville has surprised and impressed, and speculate on where it might go when it returns to Hulu in the fall."," Cassandra Lease, Dan Toland, Gordon Linzner (m), Dale Meyer-Curley, Melissa Honig"
20,Sun,7:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 4,Media,Panel,Welcome,Game of Thrones: And Now Our Watch Is Ended,"After eight years, the HBO adaptation of George R R Martin's A Song of ice and Fire drew to a close with a divisive season full of controversies, ranging from rushed storylines to failures in character development to a rogue coffee cup.  We hope to discuss the winners and losers of the Game as well as determine whether these six episodes undermined the legacy of both the previous seasons and the books themselves."," Mark W. Richards, Naomi Hinchen (m), Santiago Rivas, Don Chase, Marianna Martin PhD"
21,Sun,10:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 4,Media,Panel,Welcome,Tabletop Gaming as a Spectator Sport,"Over the last few years, the trend toward video game streaming has carried over to the tabletop RPG world. Shows such as Critical Role, Relics and Rarities, and Sirens of the Realm, many of which spotlight actors and experts engaging in long-form improv storytelling, can garner dozens of millions of views per episode. What factors draw such a large audience to view Dungeons and Dragons as entertainment to be watched, rather than played?"," Lisa Padol, Aran P. Ink, Tori Queeno, Melissa Honig (m)"
22,Mon,1:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 2,Media,Panel,Welcome,Where is Star Trek Boldly Going?,"The new showrunners of the second season of Star Trek: Discovery took the crew in new directions and ended things with a status-shattering finale. Jean-Luc Picard is set to begin his own ten-episode series, while Lower Decks takes a more lighthearted look at some underutilized corners of Starfleet. What does the future hold, and will it make you finally shell out $6 a month for CBS All Access? Join our panelists as they look forward to the upcoming voyages of the Star Trek universe!"," Jennifer Pelland, Nathan Comstock, Pablo Vazquez, Nomi S. Burstein (m)"
23,Sat,11:30 AM,1hr 15min,Faneuil,Media,Panel,Welcome,Fifteen Years of Supernatural,"Despite dying numerous times Sam and Dean Winchester are in their 15th -- and final -- season of hunting things and saving people. What's kept this show on the air for so long (besides perhaps a deal with a Crossroads Demon)? In the end, will the brothers evade the Reaper once again, or will they finally, truly, really die? And how much pie do you think Dean can really eat in one sitting?"," Don Chase, Ilene Tatroe, Lee Clever Roberts, Naomi Hinchen (m), Dr. Jim Prego"
24,Mon,11:30 AM,1hr 15min,Faneuil,Media,Panel,Welcome,Smashing the Like Button on Film Criticism,"Online video essayists have shown real skill at exploring film in new ways. Whether it's the insight underneath the nonsense of the Plinkett reviews, the eye Patrick Willems brings to old favorites dressed in sketch comedy, or Lindsay Ellis' analysis of The Hobbit that earned her a Hugo nod, there are untold numbers of film critics finding new ways to tell you that Star Wars was pretty good. We'll analyze it is we look for in online film criticism, and the ways they differ from what came before."," Sam Schreiber, Reuben Baron, Megan Kearns, Deirdre Crimmins (m)"
26,Sat,7:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 4,Media,Panel,Welcome,Let's Go To The Mall: Stranger Things,"The latest iteration of this neverending story saw Hawkins, Indiana's new Starcourt Mall under siege. Our teenaged heroes were beset on all sides by Russians, Mind Flayers, and the changing interpersonal dynamics between the kids themselves. The panel will discuss the latest season, chart the growth of the characters, and continue to pine for The Robin and Steve Show."," Kevin Eldridge (m), David Olsen, Richard Ralston, Kristin Janz, Bey Woodward"
27,Sun,1:00 PM,1hr 15min,Independence,Media,Panel,Welcome,Tears in Rain: Rutger Hauer,"In 2019, we lost Rutger Hauer, a character actor with a long pedigree in genre films. Making a huge impact as self-aware replicant Roy Batty in 1982's Blade Runner, Hauer could be seen in innumerable SF/F properties, most notably The Hitcher, Ladyhawke, the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Sin City, and even Galavant. Join us as we say goodbye to a much beloved mainstay of nearly forty years of science fiction and fantasy entertainment."," Richard Ralston, Griffin Ess , Rachel Kenley, Dan ""Grim"" Marsh (m)"
31,Sun,2:30 PM,1hr 15min,Independence,Media,Panel,Welcome,Love Is The Message: Pose,"For two seasons and counting, FX's Pose has followed the largely African-American and Latinx ballroom culture in Reagan/Bush-era New York. An array of LGBTQ+, non-gender-conforming models and performers embrace the love and support of their found families as the ever-spiraling AIDS pandemic becomes a central focus of a community that's seen too many funerals. We'll discuss this series, with special attention to an underground culture that's been lacking positive representation up to this point."," Brent Weichsel, Jennifer Pelland, Megan Kearns, Donna Martinez (m)"
32,Sun,1:00 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 2,Media,Panel,Welcome,Welcome to The Good Place! Everything Is Fine.,"For four years, The Good Place has challenged us with its combination of sitcom humor and moral philosophy as it presents a fantastical vision of the afterlife. What does this show do so well to attract so many different types of viewers? What lessons can we learn from it about living our own lives ethically? Or is it all just a big joke?"," Ilene Tatroe, Andrea Martinez Corbin, Cadwell Turnbull, Andy Hicks (m), Arthur Chu"
33,Sun,8:30 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 4,Media,Panel,Welcome,The Wachowskis and Gender Representation,"Even before Lana and Lilly Wachowski became known for genre film- and television-making, they have been known for their strong, meaningful representations of trans and nonbinary people throughout their oeuvre.  Have the Wachowskis' portrayals helped normalize trans and nonbinary people in American culture?  What are the highlights—and lowlights—of the Wachowskis' careers in this regard?  And what would you like to see?"," Brent Weichsel, Mink Rose, Reuben Baron, Max Impakt / Ask Kaylee Frye (m), Lee C. Hillman (Gwendolyn Grace)"
35,Fri,8:30 PM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Media,Panel,Welcome,Crisis on (Nearly) Infinite Arrowverse Series,"Now in its eighth season, the Arrowverse has just finished the massive Crisis on Infinite Earths, spreading across Arrow, The Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, and Batwoman, while also bringing in Black Lightning and a wide array of DC superheroes from decades past.

Burstein, Kevin Eldridge, Jonathan Woodward"
36,Sun,11:30 AM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Media,Panel,Welcome,Captain Marvel Has Nothing To Prove To You,"February's Captain Marvel was the culmination of two years of the typical online calls for boycotts and attempts to influence its reviews negatively when a tentpole franchise doesn't have a white man in the lead; it nevertheless found considerable success, if its box office and an internet full of pictures of fans dressed as Carol Danvers is anything to go by. As the first MCU release with a woman as the sole title character, we'll talk about what worked and what could come next."," Christopher K. Davis, Heather Urbanski (m), Lyndsay Ely, Jennifer Pelland, Victoria Janssen"
38,Sat,8:30 AM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Media,Panel,Welcome,Steven Universe: Still Always Finding A Way,"Steven Universe, which saw the release of a movie in September, continues to be a show that deals uncompromisingly with issues around gender, childhood, and family in ways both unexpected and delightful (if not without the occasional problem). It's also telling a great long-form adventure story. We'll talk about all elements of this show in a panel that, like the show itself, will appeal to fans of all ages."," Sid Hackney, Liam McGlohon , Sioban Krzywicki, Arthur Chu (m)"

Special consideration will be given to safety and transport.  How far does one go towards looking authentic without risking the safety and comfort of other attendees?  Are simulated costume guns now verboten, or at least gauche? What about bladed costume weapons? Does peace-bonding obviate the issue, or is there something more in play?  How can you modify your props to be con or stage safe?"," Jamila Sisco, Lisa J Steele, KarlS Web (m), Amy J. Murphy"
58,Sat,2:30 PM,1hr 15min,Douglas,Cosplay & Costuming,Panel,Welcome,Cross-Cultural Costuming,"When presenting a character or costume of a race, ethnicity, or culture not your own, to what issues must we be sensitive? What are the pitfalls, and how do we avoid them? Where is the line between respectful cultural representation and cultural appropriation? Not everything that is well meaning is acceptable and the distinction between the two is usually difficult to discern."," James Hinsey, Lilli Fehler (m), Monique ""Moniquill"" Poirier, Hannah Prum (Kirkette Cosplay), Milo Martinez"
67,Sat,10:00 AM,1hr 15min,Marina 1,Cosplay & Costuming,Panel,Welcome,"Using, Making, and Modifying Sewing Patterns","Drafting a pattern can be difficult, but it’s made a lot easier when you can take an existing pattern and change it into what you need.

Although especially vigorous in the YA community, “cancel culture” has doomed adult books, too. Some authors insist  that some of the critics haven’t read the books and are misrepresenting selected details.

Yet many are like Ian McEwan, who hotly denies that his new book Machines Like Me (AI, alt-universe) is in any way “science fiction.” Why is SF still denied the respectability it deserves after all these years?
