# con-sched-grid

This set of scripts will ingest a schedule listing (exported, for example, from https://github.com/olszowka/Zambia) and export HTML files containing a schedule
grid formatted as tables.

Note: At this point, if you wish to print the result (as opposed to *just* viewing in a browser), use Chrome. I'm using the non-standard CSS attribute
`-webkit-print-color-adjust: exact; ` and I've only tried this in Chrome.
